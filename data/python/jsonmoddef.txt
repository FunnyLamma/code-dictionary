json commands are very very useful, I use them a lot.
Especially the .read command.
I used it a ton in this program.
The first use that I will go over it the .read commmand.
Say you have a .txt file that you want to print with python.
Let's say it is called example.txt.
The first thing you want to do is use the with command to save the file as a variable.
Example: with open example.txt as example_file.
